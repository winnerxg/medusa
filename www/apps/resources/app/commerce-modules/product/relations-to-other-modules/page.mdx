This document showcases the link modules defined between the Product Module and other commerce modules.

## Cart Module

So, to add prices for a product variant, create a price set and add the prices as money amounts to it.

Each product variant has different inventory details. Medusa defines a link module that builds a relationship between the `ProductVariant` and `InventoryItem` data models.

When the `manage_inventory` property of a product variant is enabled, you can manage the variant's inventory in different locations through this relation.
