In this document, you’ll learn what a payment is and how it's created, captured, and refunded.

## What's a Payment?

When a payment session is authorized, a payment, represented by the [Payment data model](/references/payment/models/Payment), is created. This payment can later be captured or refunded.

A payment carries along many of the data and relations of a payment session:

- It belongs to the same payment collection.
- It’s associated with the same payment provider, which handles further payment processing.
- It stores the payment session’s `data` property in its `data` property, as it’s still useful for the payment provider’s processing.

## Capture Payments

When a payment is captured, a capture, represented by the [Capture data model](/references/payment/models/Capture), is created. It holds details related to the capture, such as the amount, the capture date, and more.

The payment can also be captured incrementally, each time a capture record is created for that amount.

## Refund Payments

When a payment is refunded, a refund, represented by the [Refund data model](/references/payment/models/Refund), is created. It holds details related to the refund, such as the amount, refund date, and more.

A payment can be refunded multiple times, and each time a refund record is created.
