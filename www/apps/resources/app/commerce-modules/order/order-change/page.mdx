## What's an Order Change?

An order change is modifying the order’s items for business purposes. For example, when a customer requests to return an item, or when a merchant suggests exchanging an item with another.

Order changes are represented by the [OrderChange data model](/references/order/models/OrderChange).

---

## Order Change Actions

An order change can have multiple underlying actions. For example, to exchange an item, you have to:

- Mark an item as returned.
- Arrange to receive the item from the customer.
- Add the new item to be sent to the customer.
- Fulfill the item and send it to the customer.

Each of these actions is represented by the [OrderChangeAction data model](/references/order/models/OrderChangeAction).

### Action Name

The `action` property of the `OrderChangeAction` holds the name of the action to perform. Based on the action, additional details are stored in the `details` object property of the data model.

## Order Change Confirmation

The `OrderChange` data model has a `status` property that indicates its current status. By default, it’s pending. At this point, the order change’s actions aren’t applied to the order yet.

To apply these changes to the order, you confirm the order change. When the order change is confirmed:

- The status of the order change is changed to `confirmed`.
- The order’s items are changed based on the order change’s actions. For example, an item is added, or an existing item’s quantity is changed.
- The order summary is modified to reflect new changes.
