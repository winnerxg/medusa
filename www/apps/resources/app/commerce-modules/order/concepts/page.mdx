In this document, you’ll learn about orders and related concepts

## Order Items

The items purchased in the order are represented by the [OrderItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderItem). An order can have multiple items.

### Item’s Product Details

The details of the purchased products are represented by the [LineItem data model](/references/order/models/LineItem). Not only does a line item hold the details of the product, but also details related to its price, adjustments due to promotions, and taxes.

## Order’s Shipping Method

An order has one or more shipping methods used to handle item shipment. Each shipping method is represented by the [ShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/ShippingMethod) that holds its details.

### data Property

When fulfilling the order, you may use a third-party fulfillment provider that requires additional custom data to be passed along from the order creation process.

The `ShippingMethod` data model has a `data` property. It’s an object used to store custom data relevant later for fulfillment.

The Medusa application passes the `data` property to the Fulfillment Module when fulfilling items.

## Order Totals

The order’s total amounts (including tax total, total after an item is returned, etc…) are represented by the [OrderSummary data model](/references/order/models/OrderSummary).

---

## Order Payments

Payments made on an order, whether they’re capture or refund payments, are recorded as transactions represented by the [Transaction data model](/references/order/models/Transaction).

An order can have multiple transactions. The sum of these transactions must be equal to the order summary’s total. Otherwise, there’s an outstanding amount.

Learn more about transactions in [this guide](../transactions/page.mdx).
