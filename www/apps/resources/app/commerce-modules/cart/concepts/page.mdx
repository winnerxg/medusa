In this document, you’ll get an overview of the main concepts of a cart.

## Shipping and Billing Addresses

A cart has a shipping and billing address. Both of these addresses are represented by the [Address data model](/references/cart/models/Address).

## Line Items

A line item, represented by the `LineItem` data model, is a product variant added to the cart. A cart has multiple line items.

A line item stores some of the product variant’s properties, such as the `product_title` and `product_description`. It also stores data related to the item’s quantity and price.

<Note>

A product variant can be from the [Product Module](../../product/page.mdx) but can also be a custom item used only in this cart.

## Shipping Methods

A shipping method, represented by the [ShippingMethod data model](/references/cart/models/ShippingMethod), is used to fulfill the items in the cart after the order is placed. A cart can have more than one shipping method.

If the shipping method is created from a shipping option, available through the [Fulfillment Module](../../fulfillment/page.mdx), its ID is stored in the `shipping_option_id`.

A shipping method can also be a custom method associated with this cart only.

### data Property

After an order is placed, you may use a third-party fulfillment provider to fulfill its shipments. If the fulfillment provider requires additional custom data to be passed along from the checkout process, you can add this data in the `ShippingMethod`'s `data` property.

The `data` property is an object used to store custom data relevant later for fulfillment.
