In this document, you'll learn what an application method is.

## What is an Application Method?

The [ApplicationMethod data model](/references/promotion/models/ApplicationMethod) defines how a promotion is applied:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
      
      Property
      
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
      
      Purpose
      
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      `type`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Does the promotion discount a fixed amount or a percentage?

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      `target_type`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Is the promotion applied on a cart item, shipping method, or the entire order?

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      `allocation`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Is the discounted amount applied on each item or split between the applicable items?

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

## Target Promotion Rules

When the promotion is applied to a cart item or a shipping method, you can restrict which items/shipping methods the promotion is applied to.

The `ApplicationMethod` data model has a collection of `PromotionRule` records to restrict which items or shipping methods the promotion applies to. The `target_rules` property represents this relation.

In this example, the promotion is only applied on products in the cart having the SKU `SHIRT`.

## Buy Promotion Rules

When the promotion’s type is `buyget`, you must specify the “buy X” condition. For example, a cart must have two shirts before the promotion can be applied.

The application method has a collection of `PromotionRule` items to define the “buy X” rule. The `buy_rules` property represents this relation.

In this example, the cart must have two products with the SKU `SHIRT` for the promotion to be applied.
