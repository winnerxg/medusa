In this document, you’ll learn about the main promotion and rule concepts in the Promotion Module.

## What is a Promotion?

A promotion, represented by the [Promotion data model](/references/promotion/models/Promotion), represents a discount applied on cart items, shipping methods, or entire orders.

A promotion has two types:

- `standard`: A standard promotion with rules.
- `buyget`: “A buy X get Y” promotion with rules.

## PromotionRule

A promotion can be restricted by a set of rules, each rule is represented by the [PromotionRule data model](/references/promotion/models/PromotionRule). For example, you can create a promotion that only customers of the `VIP` customer group can use.

A `PromotionRule`'s `attribute` property indicates the property's name to which this rule is applied. For example, `customer_group_id`. Its value is stored in the `PromotionRuleValue` data model. So, a rule can have multiple values.

When testing whether a promotion can be applied to a cart, the rule's `attribute` property and its values are tested on the cart itself. For example, the cart's customer must be part of the customer group(s) indicated in the promotion rule's value.

## Flexible Rules

The `PromotionRule`'s `operator` property adds more flexibility to the rule’s condition rather than simple equality (`eq`).

For example, to restrict the promotion to only `VIP` and `B2B` customer groups:

- Add a `PromotionRule` with its `attribute` property set to `customer_group_id` and `operator` property to `in`.
- Add two `PromotionRuleValue` associated with the rule: one with the value `VIP` and the other `B2B`.

In this case, a customer’s group must be in the `VIP` and `B2B` set of values to use the promotion.
