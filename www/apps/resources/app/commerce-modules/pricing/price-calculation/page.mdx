# {metadata.title}

In this document, you'll learn how prices are calculated when you use the `calculatePrices` method of the Pricing Module's main service.

## Overview

The [calculatePrices method](/references/pricing/calculatePrices) accepts the ID of one or more price sets and a context. It returns a price object with the best matching price for each price set.

---

## Calculation Context

The context is an object passed as a second parameter to the `calculatePrices` method. It must contain at least the `currency_code`. Only prices in the price sets with the same currency code are considered for the price selection.

For example:

```ts
const price = await pricingModuleService.calculatePrices(
  { id: [priceSetId] },
  {
    context: {
      currency_code: currencyCode,
    },
  }
)
```

The context object can also contain any custom rules, with the key being the `rule_attribute` of a rule type and its value being the rule's value.

For example:

```ts
const price = await pricingModuleService.calculatePrices(
  { id: [priceSetId] },
  {
    context: {
      currency_code: currencyCode,
      region_id: "US",
    },
  }
)
```

---

## Returned Price Object

For each price set, the method selects two prices:

- The calculated price: a price that belongs to a price list. If there are no prices associated with a price list, itâ€™ll be the same as the original price.
- The original price: If the calculated price's price list type is `override`, then the original price will be the same as the calculated price. Otheriwse, a price that doesn't belong to a price list.

After the original and calculated prices are selected, the method will use them to create a price object for each price set.

The price object has the following properties:

<TypeList
  types={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "`string`",
      description: "The ID of the price set from which the price was selected."
    },
    {
      name: "is_calculated_price_price_list",
      type: "`boolean`",
      description: "Whether the calculated price belongs to a price list. As mentioned earlier, if no valid price list is found, the calculated price is set to the original price, which doesn't belong to a price list."
    },
    {
      name: "calculated_amount",
      type: "`number`",

## Example

Consider the following rule types and price sets:

```ts
const ruleTypes = await pricingModuleService.createRuleTypes([
  {
    name: "Region",
    rule_attribute: "region_id",
  },
  {
    name: "City",
    rule_attribute: "city",
  },
])

const priceSet = await pricingModuleService.createPriceSets({
  rules: [
    { rule_attribute: "region_id" },
    { rule_attribute: "city" },
  ],
  prices: [
    //default
    {
      amount: 500,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {},
    },
    // prices with rules
    {
      amount: 400,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        region_id: "PL",
      },
    },
    {
      amount: 450,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        city: "krakow",
      },
    },
    {
      amount: 500,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        city: "warsaw",
        region_id: "PL",
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

### Default Price Selection

        }

        max_quantity: null,

    }
    ```

    - Original price selection: since there are no provided rules in the context, the original price is the default price.
    - Calculated price selection: since there are no associated price lists, the calculated price is set to the original price.

    - Original price selection: Since the second price of the price set has the same context as the provided one, it's selected as the original price.
    - Calculated price selection: since there are no associated price lists, the calculated price is set to the original price.

    ```

    - Original price selection: The fourth price in the price list is selected based on the following process:
      - There are no prices having the same rules as the context.
      - Retrieve all prices matching some combination of the rules in the context.
      - Sort the prices in descending order by their number of rules, each rule type's default priority, and the priority of the rule values.
        - All rule types, in this case, don't have a priority. So, the sorting depends on the number of rules each price has.
      - The fourth price has two rules, and the second and third have one rule. So, the fourth price is selected as the original price.
    - Calculated price selection: since there are no associated price lists, the calculated price is set to the original price.

    - Original price selection: The process is explained in the Context without Exact Matching Rules section.
    - Calculated price selection: The first price of the price list is selected based on the following process:
      - The price set has a price list associated with it. So, retrieve its prices and sort them in ascending order by their amount.
      - Since the first price of the price list has the lowest amount, it's selected as the calculated price.
