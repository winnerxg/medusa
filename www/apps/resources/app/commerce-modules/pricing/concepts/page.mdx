In this document, youâ€™ll learn about the main concepts in the Pricing Module, and how data is stored and related.

## Price Set

A [PriceSet](/references/pricing/models/PriceSet) represents a collection of prices that are linked to a resource (for example, a product or a shipping option). Each of these prices are represented by the [Price data module](/references/pricing/models/Price).

## Rule Type

Each price within a price set can be applied for different conditions. These conditions are represented as rule types.

A [RuleType](/references/pricing/models/RuleType) defines custom conditions. A rule type has a unique `rule_attribute` which indicates the property this rule applies on. For example, `region_id`.

This is referenced when setting a rule of a price. For example:

export const ruleTypeHighlights = [
  ["8", "region_id", "Reference a rule type by its `rule_attribute`."],
  ["8", `"PL"`, "The value of this rule."]
]

```ts highlights={ruleTypeHighlights}
const priceSet = await pricingModuleService.addPrices({
  priceSetId,
  prices: [
   {
      amount: 500,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        region_id: "PL",
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

## Price List

A [PriceList](/references/pricing/models/PriceList) is a group of prices only enabled if their conditions and rules are satisfied. A price list has optional `start_date` and `end_date` properties, which indicate the date range in which a price list can be applied.

Its associated prices are represented by the `Price` data model.
