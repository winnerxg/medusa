In this document, you'll learn about price rules for price sets and price lists.

## Price Rule

Each rule of a price within a price set is represented by the [PriceRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceRule), which holds the value of a rule type. The `Price` data model has a `rules_count` property, which indicates how many rules, represented by `PriceRule`, are applied to the price.

For example, you create a `zip_code` rule type. Then, a price within the price set can have the rule value `10557`, indicating that the price can only be applied within the `10557` zip code.

Each price within the price set can have different values for the same rule type.

For example:

Each price can have multiple rules applied to it as well.

For example, a price can have the rules `zip_code` and `region_id` applied to it. In this case, the value of each rule is represented by a `PriceRule`.

## Restrict Price Rules

The [PriceSetRuleType data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceSetRuleType) indicates what rules the prices can have within a price set. It creates a relation between the `PriceSet` and `RuleType` data models.

For example, to use the `zip_code` rule type on a price in a price set, the rule type must first be enabled on the price set through the `PriceSetRuleType`.

## Price List Rules

Rules that can be applied to a price list are represented by the [PriceListRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceListRule). The `rules_count` property of a `PriceList` indicates how many rules are applied to it.

Each rule of a price list can have more than one value, representing its values by the [PriceListRuleValue data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceListRuleValue).
