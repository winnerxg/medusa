In this document, youâ€™ll learn how registered and unregistered accounts are distinguished in the Medusa application.

## `has_account` Property

The [Customer data model](/references/customer/models/Customer) has a `has_account` property, which is a boolean that indicates whether a customer is registerd.

When a guest customer places an order, a new `Customer` record is created with `has_account` set to `false`.

When this or another guest customer registers an account with the same email, a new `Customer` record is created with `has_account` set to `true`.

## Email Uniqueness

The above behavior means that two `Customer` records may exist of the same email. However, the main difference is the `has_account` property's value.

So, there can only be one guest customer (having `has_account=false`) and one registered customer (having `has_account=true`) with the same email.
