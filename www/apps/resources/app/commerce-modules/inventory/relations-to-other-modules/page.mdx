This document showcases the link modules defined between the Inventory Module and other commerce modules.

## Product Module

Each product variant has different inventory details. Medusa defines a link module that builds a relationship between the `ProductVariant` and `InventoryItem` data models.

A product variant, whose `manage_inventory` property is enabled, has an associated inventory item. Through that inventory's items relations in the Inventory Module, you can manage and check the variant's inventory quantity.

## Stock Location Module

Reservation items and inventory items are associated with a location. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ReservationItem` and `StockLocation` data models, and the `InventoryLevel` and `StockLocation` data models.

The stock location provides address details of the location.
