In this document, you’ll learn how tax lines are calculated and what a tax provider is.

## Tax Lines Calculation

Tax lines are calculated and retrieved using the [getTaxLines method of the Tax Module’s main service](/references/tax/getTaxLines). It accepts an array of line items and shipping methods, and the context of the calculation.

It returns the tax lines that are used to adjust the cart’s tax and grand totals.

```ts
const taxLines = await taxModuleService.getTaxLines(
  [
    {
      id: "cali_123",
      product_id: "prod_123",
      unit_price: 1000,
      quantity: 1,
    },
    {
      id: "casm_123",
      shipping_option_id: "so_123",
      unit_price: 2000,
    },
  ],
  {
    address: {
      country_code: "us",
    },
  }
)
```

The context object is used to determine which tax regions and rates to use in the calculation. It includes properties related to the address and customer.

The example above returns the tax lines based on the tax region for the United States.

## Using the Tax Provider in the Calculation

The tax lines retrieved by the `getTaxLines` method are actually retrieved from the tax region’s provider.

A tax provider module whose main service implements the logic to shape tax lines. Each tax region has a tax provider.

The Tax Module provides a `system` tax provider that only transforms calculated item and shipping tax rates into the required return type.
