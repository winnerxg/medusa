In this document, you’ll learn about tax rates and rules.

## What are Tax Rates?

A tax rate is a percentage amount used to calculate the tax amount for each taxable item’s price, such as line items or shipping methods, in a cart. The sum of all calculated tax amounts are then added to the cart’s total as a tax total.

Each tax region has a default tax rate. This tax rate is applied to all taxable items of a cart in that region.

### Combinable Tax Rates

Tax regions can have parent tax regions. To inherit the tax rates of the parent tax region, set the `is_combinable` of the child’s tax rates to `true`.

Then, when tax rates are retrieved for a taxable item in the child region, both the child and the parent tax regions’ applicable rates are returned.

## Override Tax Rates with Rules

You can create tax rates that override the default for specific conditions or rules. For example, the default tax rate is 10%, but for products of type “Shirt” is %15.

A tax region can have multiple tax rates, and each tax rate can have multiple tax rules. The [TaxRateRule data model](/references/tax/models/TaxRateRule) represents a tax rate’s rule.

These two properties of the data model identify the rule’s target:

- `reference`: the name of the table in the database that this rule points to. For example, `product_type`.
- `reference_id`: the ID of the data model’s record that this points to. For example, a product type’s ID.

So, to override the default tax rate for product types “Shirt”, you create a tax rate and associate with it a tax rule whose `reference` is `product_type` and `reference_id` the ID of the “Shirt” product type.
