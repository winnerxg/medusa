If you are experiencing connection issues when trying to access your Medusa backend from a storefront or the admin dashboard, it is most likely due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

You might see a log in your browser console, that looks like this:

![CORS error log](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1668003322/Medusa%20Docs/Other/jnHK115_udgf2n.png)

In your `medusa-config.js` , you should ensure that you've configured your CORS settings correctly:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      storeCors: process.env.STORE_CORS,
      adminCors: process.env.ADMIN_CORS,
    },
    // ...
  },
})
```
