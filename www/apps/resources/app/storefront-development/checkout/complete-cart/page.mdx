import { CodeTabs, CodeTab } from "docs-ui"

export const metadata = {
  title: `Checkout Step 5: Complete Cart`,
}

# {metadata.title}

Once you finish any required actions with the third-party payment provider, you can complete the cart and place the order.

To complete the cart, send a request to the [Complete Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsidcomplete).

For example:

```ts
fetch(
  `http://localhost:9000/store/carts/${cartId}/complete`,
  {
    credentials: "include",
    method: "POST",
  }
)
.then((res) => res.json())
.then(({ type, cart, order, error }) => {
  if (type === "cart" && cart) {
    // an error occured
    console.error(error)
  } else if (type === "order" && order) {
    // TODO redirect to order success page
    alert("Order placed.")
    console.log(order)
    // unset cart ID from local storage
    localStorage.removeItem("cart_id")
  }
})
```

In the response of the request, the `type` field determines whether the cart completion was successful:

- If the `type` is `cart`, it means the cart completion failed. The `error` response field holds the error details.
- If the `type` is `order`, it means the cart was completed and the order was placed successfully.

When the cart completion is successful, it's important to unset the cart ID from the `localStorage`, as the cart is no longer usable.

## React Example with Default System Payment Provider

For example, to complete the cart when the default system payment provider is used:

export const highlights = [
  ["4", "useCart", "The `useCart` hook was defined in the Cart React Context documentation."],
  ["10", "handlePayment", "This function sends the request\nto the Medusa application to complete the cart."],
  ["21", "TODO", "If you're integrating a third-party payment provider,\nyou perform the custom logic before completing the cart."],
  ["24", "fetch", "Send a request to the Medusa application\nto complete the cart and place the order."],
  ["33", `type === "cart"`, "If the `type` returned is `cart`,\nit means an error occurred and the cart wasn't completed."],
  ["36", `type === "order"`, "If the `type` returned is `order`,\nit means the cart was completed and the order was placed successfully."],
  ["40", "refreshCart", "Unset and reset the cart."],
  ["47", "button", "This button triggers the `handlePayment` function when clicked."]
]

```tsx highlights={highlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { useState } from "react"
import { useCart } from "../../providers/cart"

export default function SystemDefaultPayment() {
  const { cart, refreshCart } = useCart()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  const handlePayment = (
    e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>
  ) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    if (!cart) {
      return
    }

    setLoading(true)
    
    // TODO perform any custom payment handling logic
    
    // complete the cart
    fetch(
      `http://localhost:9000/store/carts/${cart.id}/complete`,
      {
        credentials: "include",
        method: "POST",
      }
    )
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(({ type, cart, order, error }) => {
      if (type === "cart" && cart) {
        // an error occured
        console.error(error)
      } else if (type === "order" && order) {
        // TODO redirect to order success page
        alert("Order placed.")
        console.log(order)
        refreshCart()
      }
    })
    .finally(() => setLoading(false))
  }

  return (
    <button 
      onClick={handlePayment}
      disabled={loading}
    >
      Place Order
    </button>
  )
}
```

In the example above, you create a `handlePayment` function in the payment component. In this function, you:

- Optionally perform any required actions with the third-party payment provider. For example, authorize the payment. For the default system payment provider, no actions are required.
- Send a request to the Complete Cart API route once all actions with the third-party payment provider are performed.
- In the received response of the request, if the `type` is `cart`, it means that the cart completion failed. The error is set in the `error` response field.
- If the `type` is `order`, it means the card was completed and the order was placed successfully. You can access the order in the `order` response field.
- When the order is placed, you must unset the `cart_id` from the `localStorage`. You can redirect the customer to an order success page at this point.

## React Example with Third-Party Provider

Refer to the [Stripe guide](../payment/stripe/page.mdx) for an example on integrating a third-party provider and implementing card completion.
