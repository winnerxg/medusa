2. **Address:** Enter shipping/billing address details.
3. **Shipping**: Choose a shipping method.
4. **Payment:** Choose a payment provider.
5. **Complete Cart:** Perform any payment action necessary (for example, enter card details), complete the cart, and place the order.

You can combine steps based on your desired checkout flow.
