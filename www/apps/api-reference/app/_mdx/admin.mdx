<Note type="warning" title="Production Warning">

Medusa v2.0 is in development and not suitable for production
environments. As such, the API reference is incomplete and subject to
change, so please use it with caution.

</Note>

This API reference includes Medusa's Admin APIs, which are REST APIs exposed by the Medusa application. They are used to perform admin functionalities or create an admin dashboard to access and manipulate your commerce store's data.

All API Routes are prefixed with `/admin`. So, during development, the API Routes will be available under the path `http://localhost:9000/admin`. For production, replace `http://localhost:9000` with your Medusa application URL.

## Authentication

There are three ways to send authenticated requests to the Medusa server: Using an admin user's API token, using a JWT token in a bearer authorization header, or using a cookie session ID.

### Bearer Authorization with JWT Tokens

Use a JWT token in a request's bearer authorization header to send authenticated requests. Authentication state is managed by the client, which is ideal for Jamstack applications and mobile applications.

#### How to Obtain the JWT Token

{/* TODO add correct link to auth route */}

JWT tokens are obtained by sending a request to the authentication route passing it the user's email and password in the request body.

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST '{backend_url}/auth/admin/emailpass' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

If authenticated successfully, an object is returned in the response with the property `token` being the JWT token.

#### How to Use the JWT Token

Pass the JWT token in the authorization bearer header:


```bash
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
```

---

### API Token

Use a user's API Token to send authenticated requests.

<Note>

This authentication method relies on using another authentication method first, as you must be an authenticated user to create an API token.

</Note>

#### How to Create an API Token for a User

Use the [Create API Key API Route](#api-keys_postapikeys) to create an API token:

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:9000/admin/api-keys' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}' \
--data '{
    "title": "my token",
    "type": "secret"
}'
```

{/* TODO add a link to the API key object */}

An `api_key` object is returned in the response. You need its `token` property.

#### How to Use the API Token


The API token can be used by providing it in a basic authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Basic {api_key_token}
```

---

### Cookie Session ID

When you authenticate a user and create a cookie session ID for them, the cookie session ID is passed automatically when sending the request from the browser, or with tools like Postman.

### How to Obtain the Cookie Session

To obtain a cookie session ID, you must have a [JWT token for bearer authentication](#bearer-authorization-with-jwt-tokens).

{/* TODO add a link to the session authentication route. */}

Then, send a request to the session authentication API route. To view the cookie session ID, pass the `-v` option to the `curl` command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST '{backend_url}/auth/session' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You
should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:


```bash
Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;
```

#### How to Use the Cookie Session ID in cURL

Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass
it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:


```bash
curl '{backend_url}/admin/products' \
-H 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'
```


Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.

#### Including Credentials in the Fetch API

If you're sending requests using JavaScript's Fetch API, you must pass the `credentials` option 
with the value `include` to all the requests you're sending. For example:

```js
fetch(`<BACKEND_URL>/admin/products`, {
  credentials: "include",
})
```

## HTTP Compression

If you've enabled HTTP Compression in your Medusa configurations, and you 
want to disable it for some requests, you can pass the `x-no-compression`
header in your requests:

```bash
x-no-compression: true
```

## Select Fields and Relations

Many API Routes accept a `fields` query that allows you to select which fields and relations should be returned in a record.
Fields and relations are separated by a comma `,`.

For example:

```bash
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title,handle' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```

This returns only the `title` and `handle` fields of a product.

### Fields Operator

By default, only the selected fields and relations are returned in the response.

Before every field or relation, you can pass one of the following operators to change the default behavior:

- `+`: Add the field to the fields returned by default. For example, `+title` returns the `title` field along with the fields returned by default.
- `-`: Remove the field from the fields returned by default. For example, `-title` removes the `title` field from the fields returned by default.

### Select Relations

To select a relation, pass to `fields` the relation name prefixed by `*`. For example:

```bash
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=*variants' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```

This returns the variants of each product.

### Select Fields in a Relation

The `*` prefix selects all fields of the relation's data model.

To select a specific field, pass a `.<field>` suffix instead of the `*` prefix. For example, `variants.title`.

To specify multiple fields, pass each of the fields with the `<relation>.<field>` format, separated by a comma.

For example:

```bash
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=variants.title,variants.sku' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```

This returns the variants of each product, but the variants only have their `id`, `title`, and `sku` fields. The `id` is always included.

## Query Parameter Types


This section covers how to pass some common data types as query parameters.


### Strings


You can pass a string value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?title=Shirt" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


If the string has any characters other than letters and numbers, you must
encode them.


For example, if the string has spaces, you can encode the space with `+` or
`%20`:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?title=Blue%20Shirt" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


You can use tools like [this one](https://www.urlencoder.org/) to learn how
a value can be encoded.


### Integers


You can pass an integer value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?offset=1" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


### Boolean


You can pass a boolean value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?is_giftcard=true" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


### Date and DateTime


You can pass a date value in the form `<parameter_name>=<value>`. The date
must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.


For example:


```bash
curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


You can also pass the time using the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Please
note that the `T` and `Z` here are fixed.


For example:


```bash
curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17T07:22:30Z" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


### Array


Each array value must be passed as a separate query parameter in the form
`<parameter_name>[]=<value>`. You can also specify the index of each
parameter in the brackets `<parameter_name>[0]=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?sales_channel_id[]=sc_01GPGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7&sales_channel_id[]=sc_234PGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


Note that the `-g` parameter passed to `curl` disables errors being thrown
for using the brackets. Read more
[here](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-g).


### Object


Object parameters must be passed as separate query parameters in the form
`<parameter_name>[<key>]=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17&created_at[gt]=2022-09-17" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```

## Pagination

### Query Parameters


In listing API Routes, such as list customers or list products, you can control the pagination using the query parameters `limit` and `offset`.


`limit` is used to specify the maximum number of items to be returned in the response. `offset` is used to specify how many items to skip before returning the resulting records.


Use the `offset` query parameter to change between pages. For example, if the limit is `50`, at page `1` the offset should be `0`; at page `2` the offset should be `50`, and so on.


For example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?limit=5" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


### Response Fields


In the response of listing API Routes, aside from the records retrieved,
there are three pagination-related fields returned:


- `limit`: the maximum number of items that can be returned in the response.
- `offset`: the number of items that were skipped before the records in the result.
- `count`: the total number of available items of this data model. It can be used to determine how many pages are there.


For example, if the `count` is `100` and the `limit` is `50`, divide the
`count` by the `limit` to get the number of pages: `100/50 = 2 pages`.


### Sort Order


The `order` field (available on API Routes that support pagination) allows you to
sort the retrieved items by a field of that item.

For example, pass the query parameter `order=created_at` to sort products by their `created_at` field:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?order=created_at" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```

By default, the sort direction is ascending. To change it to
descending, pass a dash (`-`) before the field name.

For example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?order=-created_at" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}'
```


This sorts the products by their `created_at` field in the descending order.
