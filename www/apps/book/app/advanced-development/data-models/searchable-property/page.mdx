In this chapter, you'll learn what a searchable property is and how to define it.

## What is a Searchable Property?

Methods generated by the [service factory](../../modules/service-factory/page.mdx) that accept filters, such as `list{ModelName}s`, accept a `q` property as part of the filters.

When the `q` filter is passed, the query is applied on searchable properties in a data model.

## Define a Searchable Property

The `searchable` method of the `model` utility indicates that a `text` property is searchable.

For example:

```ts
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const MyCustom = model.define("my_custom", {
  name: model.text().searchable(),
  // ...
})

export default MyCustom
```

In this example, the `name` property is searchable.

### Search Example

If you pass a `q` filter to the `listMyCustoms` method:

```ts
const myCustoms = await helloModuleService.listMyCustoms({
  q: "John",
})
```

The `q` filter is applied on the `name` property of the `MyCustom` records.
