In this chapter, you’ll learn what a link module is and how to use the remote link in your customizations.

## What is a Link Module?

A link module is a module whose only purpose is to define a relationship between two modules’ data models. The relationship is represented as a pivot or link table in the database, pointing at the primary keys of each data model.

For example, Medusa has a link module that defines a relationship between the Product and Pricing modules. It links the `ProductVariant` and `PriceSet` data models.

Link modules create the relationship between modules while maintaining module isolation. The Medusa application only creates the link tables when both modules are available.

Link modules are currently only available for Medusa’s commerce modules.
