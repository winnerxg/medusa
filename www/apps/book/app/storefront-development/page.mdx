In the next chapters, you’ll learn about building a storefront for your Medusa backend.

## Storefronts in Medusa’s Architecture

Storefronts are built separately from the Medusa application. They interact with the Medusa application through the Store API routes.

You're free to choose how to build your storefront. You can start with our Next.js starter storefront or build a storefront from scratch using your preferred framework or tech stack.

<Note title="Tip">

To learn how to build a storefront from scratch, check out the [Storefront Development guides](!resources!/storefront-development) in the Learning Resources documentation.
