## What is a Scheduled Job?

A scheduled job is a function executed at a specified interval of time in the background of your Medusa application. It’s like a cron job that runs during the application's runtime.

For example, you can synchronize your inventory with an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system once a day using a scheduled job.

## How to Create a Scheduled Job?

<Note type="check">

- [Redis](https://redis.io/) is installed and Redis server is running.

</Note>

A scheduled job is created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/jobs` directory.

For example, create the file `src/jobs/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/jobs/hello-world.ts"
import { ScheduledJobConfig } from "@medusajs/medusa"

// the scheduled-job function
export default function () {
  console.log("Time to say hello world!")
}

// the job's configurations
export const config: ScheduledJobConfig = {
  name: "hello-world",
  // execute every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *",
}
```

A scheduled job file must export:

- The function to be executed whenever it’s time to run the scheduled job.
- A configuration object defining the job. It has two properties:
    - `name`: a unique name for the job.
    - `schedule`: a [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/).

This scheduled job executes every minute and logs into the terminal `Time to say hello world!`.

### Test Scheduled Jobs

To test out your scheduled job:

1. Uncomment the following line in the `medusa-config.js` file:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisUrl: REDIS_URL,
    // ...
  },
})
```

2. Start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

After a minute, the following message will be logged to the terminal:

```bash
info:    Processing scheduled job: hello-world
Time to say hello world!
```

The first line indicates that the application is executing the scheduled job. The second line is the text logged by the scheduled job.

## When to Use Scheduled Jobs

<Note title="Use scheduled jobs when" type="success">

- You're executing an action at a specified time interval during application runtime.
- The action must be executed automatically.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use scheduled jobs if" type="error">

- You want the action to execute at a specified time interval while the Medusa application **isn't** running. Instead, use the operating system's equivalent of a cron job.
- You want to execute the action once. Use loaders instead.
- You want to execute the action if an event occurs. Use subscribers instead.

</Note>

## Resolve Resources

The scheduled job function receives an object parameter that has a `container` property. Its value is the Medusa container, which you can use to resolve resources in your Medusa application, such as services.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["12", "resolve", "Resolve the Product Module's main service."],
  ["12", "ModuleRegistrationName.PRODUCT", "The resource registration name imported from `@medusajs/modules-sdk`."]
]

```ts title="src/jobs/hello-world.ts" highlights={highlights}
import {
  ScheduledJobArgs,
  ScheduledJobConfig,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { IProductModuleService } from "@medusajs/types"
import { ModuleRegistrationName } from "@medusajs/modules-sdk"

export default async function ({
  container,
}: ScheduledJobArgs) {
  const productModuleService: IProductModuleService =
    container.resolve(ModuleRegistrationName.PRODUCT)

  const [, count] = await productModuleService.listAndCount()

  console.log(
    `Time to check products! You have ${count} product(s)`
  )
}

export const config: ScheduledJobConfig = {
  name: "hello-world",
  // execute every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *",
}
```

In the scheduled job function, you resolve the Product Module's main service and retrieve the number of products in the store, then log the number in the terminal.
